.SH NAME
pqiv \- quick image viewer
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpqiv\fR [options] [filename(s)...]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpqiv\fR is a simple command line image viewer inspired by qiv. It is highly
customizable and supports a variety of formats.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
.\"
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-transparent\-background
Draw \fBpqiv\fR's window borderless and transparent. In window mode, a mouse
click activates and deactivates window decorations.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-slideshow\-interval=\fISECONDS\fR
In slideshow mode (Activated by \fB\-\-slideshow\fR or key \fBs\fR by default),
cycle through images at this rate. Floating point values are supported, e.g.
use 0.5 to move through the images at a rate of two images per second.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-fullscreen
Start in fullscreen mode. Fullscreen can be toggled by pressing \fBf\fR at
runtime by default.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-F  ", " \-\-fade
Fade between images. See also \fB\-\-fade\-duration\fR.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-hide\-info\-box
Initially hide the info box. Whether the box is visible can be toggled by
pressing \fBi\fR at runtime by default.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-lazy\-load
\fBpqiv\fR normally processes all command line arguments before displaying its
main window. With this option, the window is shown as soon as the first image
has been found and loaded.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-sort
Instead of storing images in the order they are given on the command line and
found within directories, sort them. The default order is by name (natural
order). See \fB\-\-sort\-key\fR to change the order.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \-\-window\-position=\fIPOSITION\fR
Set the initial window position. \fIPOSITION\fR may either be
.RS
.IP x,y 5
screen coordinates, or
.IP off
to not position the window at all.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-additional\-from\-stdin
Read additional filenames/folders from the standard input. This option
conflicts with \fB\-\-commands\-from\-stdin\fR.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-slideshow
Start in slideshow mode. Slideshow mode can be toggled at runtime by pressing
\fBs\fR by default.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-scale\-images\-up
Scale images up to fill the whole screen. This can be toggled at runtime by
pressing \fBt\fR by default. See also \fB\-\-disable\-scaling\fR.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-T ", " \-\-window\-title=\fITITLE\fR
Set the title of the window. \fBpqiv\fR substitutes several variables into \fITITLE\fR:
.RS
.IP $BASEFILENAME 15
The base file name of the current file (e.g. `\fIimage.png\fR'),
.IP $FILENAME
The file name of the current file (e.g. `\fI/home/user/image.png\fR'),
.IP $WIDTH
The width of the current image in pixels,
.IP $HEIGHT
The height of the current image in pixels,
.IP $ZOOM
The current zoom level,
.IP $IMAGE_NUMBER
The index of the current image,
.IP $IMAGE_COUNT
The total number of images.
.PP
The default is `pqiv: $FILENAME ($WIDTHx$HEIGHT) $ZOOM% [$IMAGE_NUMBER/$IMAGE_COUNT]'.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.BR \-z ", " \-\-zoom\-level=\fIFLOAT\fR
Set the initial zoom level as a floating point value, i.e., 1.0 is 100%. This
only applies to the first image, other images are scaled according to the scale
mode (see \fB\-\-scale\-images\-up\fR and \fB\-\-disable\-scaling\fR) and
window size.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-1 ", " \-\-command\-1=\fICOMMAND\fR
Bind the external \fICOMMAND\fR to key 1. You can use 2..9 to bind further
commands. The \fBACTIONS\fR feature (see below) allows to bind further keys to
other commands. \fICOMMAND\fR is executed using the default shell processor.
`$1' is substituted with the current file name.
.RS
.PP
If \fICOMMAND\fR begins with `>', its standard output is displayed in a popup window.
.PP
If \fICOMMAND\fR begins with `|', the current image is piped to its standard
input, and its standard output is loaded as an image. This can be used to e.g.
process images.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-bind\-key=\fIKEY BINDING\fR
Rebind a key to an action. The syntax is
.RS
.RS
key sequence { command(parameter); command(parameter); }
.RE
A key sequence may be one or more characters, or special characters supplied as
`<name>', where name is a GDK key specifier or a mouse button (`Mouse-1') or a
scrolling direction (`Mouse-Scroll-1'). If you e.g. use `a<Control>b', then a
user must hit `a' followed by control + `b' to trigger the command. It is possible
to bind `a' and `ab' as well. The action bound to `a' will then be slightly delayed
to allow a user to hit `b'. The semicolon separating commands is optional. See
\fBACTIONS\fR below for available commands.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-browse
For each command line argument, additionally load all images from the image's
directory. \fBpqiv\fR will still start at the image that was given as the first
parameter.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-commands\-from\-stdin
Read commands from the standard input. See the \fBACTIONS\fR section below for
syntax and available commands. This option conflicts with
\fB\-\-additional\-from\-stdin\fR.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-disable\-scaling
Completely disable scaling. This can be toggled at runtime by
pressing \fBt\fR by default. See also \fB\-\-scale\-images\-up\fR.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-end\-of\-files\-action=\fIACTION\fR
If all files have been viewed and the next image is to be viewed, either by the
user's request or because a slideshow is active, \fBpqiv\fR by default cycles
and restarts at the first image. This parameter can be used to modify this
behaviour. Valid choices for \fIACTION\fR are:
.RS
.IP quit 20
Quit \fBpqiv\fR,
.IP wait
Wait until a new image becomes available. This only makes sense if used with
e.g. \fB\-\-watch\-directories\fR,
.IP wrap (default)
Restart at the first image. In shuffle mode, choose a new random order,
.IP wrap-no-reshuffle
As wrap, but do not reshuffle in random mode.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-fade\-duration=\fISECONDS\fR
With \fB\-\-fade\fR, make each fade this long. Floating point values are
accepted, e.g. 0.5 makes each fade take half a second.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-low\-memory
Try to keep memory usage to a minimum. \fBpqiv\fR by default e.g. preloads the
next and previous image to speed up navigation and caches scaled images to
speed up redraws. This flag disables such optimizations.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-max\-depth=\fILEVELS\fR
For parameters that are directories, \fBpqiv\fR searches recursively for
images. Use this parameter to limit the depth at which \fBpqiv\fR searches.  A
level of 0 disables recursion completely, i.e. if you call pqiv with a
directory as a parameter, it will not search it at all.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-shuffle
Display files in random order. This option conflicts with \fB\-\-sort\fR. Files
are reshuffled after all images have been shown, but within one cycle, the
order is stable. The reshuffling can be disabled using
\fB\-\-end\-of\-files\-action\fR. At runtime, you can use \fBControl + R\fR by
default to toggle shuffle mode; this retains the shuffled order, i.e., you can
disable shuffle mode, view a few images, then enable it again and continue
after the last image you viewed earlier in shuffle mode.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-show\-bindings
Display the keyboard and mouse bindings and exit. This displays the key
bindings in the format accepted by \fB\-\-bind\-key\fR. See there, and the
\fBACTIONS\fR section for details on available actions.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-sort\-key=\fIPROPERTY\fR
Key to use for sorting. Supported values for \fIPROPERTY\fR are:
.RS
.IP NAME 8
To sort by filename in natural order, e.g. \fIabc32d\fR before \fIabc112d\fR,
but \fIb1\fR after both,
.IP MTIME
To sort by file modification date.
.RE
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-watch\-directories
Watch all directories supplied as parameters to \fBpqiv\fR for new files and
add them as they appear. In \fB\-\-sort\fR mode, files are sorted into the
correct position, else, they are appended to the end of the list.
See also \fB\-\-watch\-files\fR, which handles how changes to the image that is
currently being viewed are handled.
.\"
.TP
.BR \-\-watch\-files=\fIVALUE\fR
Watch files for changes on disk. Valid choices for \fIVALUE\fR are:
.RS
.IP "on (default)" 15
Watch files for changes, reload upon a change, and skip to the next file if a file is removed,
.IP changes-only
Watch files for changes, reload upon a change, but do nothing if a file is removed,
.IP off
Do not watch files for changes at all.
.PP
Note that a file that has been removed will still be removed from \fBpqiv\fR's
image list when it has been unloaded, i.e. if a user moves more than one image
away from it. (See also \fB\-\-low\-memory\fR.)
.RE

.\"
.SH ACTIONS
Actions are the building blocks for controlling \fBpqiv\fR. The syntax for
entering an action is
.RS
\fICOMMAND\fR(\fIPARAMETER\fR)
.RE
where \fICOMMAND\fR is one of the commands described in the following and
\fIPARAMETER\fR is the command's parameter. Strings are not quoted. Instead,
the closing parenthesis must be escaped by a backslash if it is used in a
string. E.g., `command(echo \\))' will output a single `)'. The available
commands are:

.\"
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
Upon startup, \fBpqiv\fR parses the file \fI~/.pqivrc\fR. It should be a
INI-style key/value file with an \fIoptions\fR section. All long form
parameters are valid keys. To set a boolean flag, set the value to 1. A set
flag inverts the meaning of the associated parameter. E.g., if you set
`\fIfullscreen=1\fR', then \fBpqiv\fR will start in fullscreen mode unless you supply
\fB\-f\fR upon startup.
.PP
As an example,
.RS
.nf
[options]
fullscreen=1
sort=1
command-1=|convert - -blur 20 -
.fi
.RE
will make \fBpqiv\fR start in fullscreen by default, sort the file list and
bind a blur filter to key \fB1\fR. The \fB\-f\fR flag on the command line will
make \fBpqiv\fR not start in fullscreen, and \fB\-n\fR will make it not sort
the list.
.PP
You can place key bindings in the format of the \fB\-\-bind\-key\fR
parameter in a special \fI[keybindings]\fR section. E.g.,
.RS
.nf
[keybindings]
x { quit(); }
q { goto_file_relative(-1); }
w { goto_file_relative(1); }
.fi
.RE
will remap \fIx\fR to quit, and \fIq\fR and \fIw\fR to move between images.
.PP
For backwards compatibility with old versions of \fBpqiv\fR, if the file does
not start with a section definition, the first line will be parsed as command
line parameters.
.SH EXAMPLES
.\"
.TP
\fBpqiv \-\-bind\-key="a { goto_file_byindex(0) }" \-\-sort foo bar.pdf\fR
Rebinds \fBa\fR to go back to the first image, and loads all files from the
\fIfoo\fR folder and \fIbar.pdf\fR, sorted.
.TP
\fBpqiv \-\-slideshow \-\-watch\-directories \-\-end\-of\-files\-action=wait \-\-slideshow\-interval=0.001 test\fR
Load all files from the \fItest\fR folder in a slideshow progressing very fast,
and in the end wait until new files become available. This effectively displays
new images as they appear in a directory and is useful e.g. if you output images
from a script that you later intent to combine into a movie and wish to monitor
progress.
.TP
\fBecho "output_file_list(); quit()" | pqiv --commands-from-stdin test\fR
Output a list of all files from the \fItest\fR folder that \fBpqiv\fR can
handle and quit.
